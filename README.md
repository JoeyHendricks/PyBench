## The project in a nutshell

Python-micro-benchmark is a library that aids in creating micro to macro performance benchmarks for 
your code to find and visualize performance bottlenecks in your implementation in a flexible way.

With an emphasis on automation and visualizations, this library can integrate your benchmark 
within a unit test framework allowing you to test your code early in the development life cycle 
and letting you render an assortment of visualizations to get the drop on a pesky performance 
problem in your code.

## Installation

Installation is easy using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) or clone the source code straight from GitHub.
```bash
pip install python-micro-benchmarks
```

## Getting Started

Getting started is straightforward after installing the package you can import the micro benchmarking object and **define a 
benchmark name** after that you can use the **run()** method to execute your benchmark on your creation and see 
if it is performing as expected.

Below you can find a simple example:

```Python
from Benchmarking import micro_benchmark as mb
from tests.stubs import FancyCode as Fc

# Give your benchmark a name
mb.test_case_name = "quick_start"

# Define you benchmark
mb.run(
    method=Fc().fast_method,  # <-- Make sure you don't call the method
    arguments=[],
    iteration=100,
    pacing=0,
    processes=2
)

# Get a letter rank how your changes compare to a previous benchmark.
letter_rank = mb.regression.letter_rank  # > A+
```

> Check out the [documentation](https://github.com/JoeyHendricks/python-micro-benchmarks/wiki) for more help to get started.

## Visualize that pesky bottleneck

Visualization are an excellent way to find out why your code slowdown or isn't working the way you would expect.
python-micro-benchmarks offers out of the box the following visualizations, so you don't need to worry how to get your eyes on that 
pesky bottleneck:

- Flame Graphs
- Code Heat Maps
- Bar charts
- Scatter plots (Coming soon)
- Line Graphs (Coming soon)

Want to visualize the data yourself or share the data in a common format, no problem python-micro-benchmarks has you covered. 
You can export your benchmarks in the following formats through the benchmark API:

- CSV
- JSON (Coming soon)

> Check out the docs for more information how to visualize or export your measurements.
