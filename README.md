## Building low level performance tests for Python with QuickPotato

QuickPotato is a low level performance testing framework that helps you gets rid of slow couch potato code.
It allows you to verify if the performance of your code is working like expected 
by being able to answer the following two questions:

- Is my code performing in the way I am expecting?
- Did this code change deteriorate the performance of my code or project?

QuickPotato provides you with all the tools needed to answer these two important 
questions in a easy, reliable, and completely automated way. Making sure that you can focus
on delivering awesome code which is lighting fast! 

## How it works

### Installation

Install using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) or download the source code from GitHub.
```bash
pip install QuickPotato
```

### Intrusive Testing

Not all functions hold the same risk as of forming a potential performance problem like others.
Therefore it is possible with QuickPotato to choose which function should be measured and profiled.

The chosen functions need to be fitted with a performance_critical decorator so QuickPotato knows that this
function needs to be tested when executed during a unit performance test.
The snippet below gives you a example of how you can decorate function for use with QuickPotato.

```python
from QuickPotato.inspect.intrusive import performance_critical


@performance_critical
def example():
    return 1 + 1

```




```python
from QuickPotato.inspect.intrusive import unit_performance_test
from example.intrusive_example import example

# Setup your unit performance test.
upt = unit_performance_test
upt.test_case_name = "Default"

# Define the boundaries for your code.
upt.max_and_min_boundary_for_average = {"max": 0.200, "min": 0.011}
        
# Run functions which are decorated as performance critical.
for _ in range(0, 10):
    example() # <-- Your function or class here.
        
# Verify if the function does not breach any defined boundaries.
results = upt.analyse_benchmark_against_defined_boundaries()
```
