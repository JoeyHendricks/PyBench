## PyBench in a nutshell

QuickPotato is a Python library that aims to make it easier to rapidly profile your software and produce powerful 
code visualizations that enables you to quickly investigate where potential performance bottlenecks are hidden.

Also, QuickPotato is trying to provide you with a path to add an automated performance testing angle to 
your regular unit tests or test-driven development test cases allowing you to test your code early in the 
development life cycle in a simple, reliable, and fast way.

## Installation

Install using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) or download the source code from GitHub.
```bash
pip install PyBench
```

## Quick Start

```
```

## Visualize that pesky bottleneck
